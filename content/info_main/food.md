Meals will be prepared by **our chef**, who will be offering delicious dishes made with local ingredients. The meal package includes **breakfast, lunch, and dinner for all five days** of the seminars. Please note that meals cannot be booked on a daily basis; the package is all-inclusive.

You may either choose the 5-day meal plan or arrange your own meals outside the festival. If you opt for the festival meal package, you will be able to share your dietary requirements, menu preferences, and any other relevant information.

The cost of the meal plan is **170 €** (3 meals per day for 5 days).
