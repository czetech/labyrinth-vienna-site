The workshops take place at [**Bildungszentrum an der Wien**](https://bildungszentrum-an-der-wien.at/#0), which serves both as our seminar rooms and the concert halls, as well as limited number of accommodation for 15 participants. Located in the Hietzing district of Vienna, the center offers a rare combination of calm surroundings, generous space, and excellent facilities for artistic and educational work.

Bildungszentrum an der Wien provides spacious seminar rooms, rehearsal spaces, a concert hall, and large green outdoor areas. This allows the entire workshop to unfold in one continuous, shared environment, where learning, practicing, resting, and informal exchange can happen naturally throughout the day. Shared meals and common spaces further support a strong sense of community and continuity during the week.

The center is situated in one of Vienna’s quietest areas, close to nature and away from the city’s rush, while still being easily accessible. The **U4 metro** line is just a few minutes away, ensuring a smooth connection to the city center. There are also paid parking options within walking distance, available for €23.10 per week at [Best in Parking](https://www.bestinparking.com/en/at/garage/park-ride-hutteldorf).

We chose Bildungszentrum an der Wien deliberately, not only for its practical infrastructure, but because its atmosphere supports what these workshops aim to offer: focus, depth, presence, and shared experience. Living and working together in one place creates the conditions for meaningful musical exploration and genuine exchange beyond the classroom.
