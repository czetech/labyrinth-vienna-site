This workshop with **Nora Thiele** focuses on rhythmic improvisation for instrumentalists and singers. Working through practical exercises and group interaction, the session explores rhythm as a shared, physical, and musical language. Drawing on Nora’s experience with frame drums, voice, and movement, participants will experiment with pulse, texture, and form, and develop tools for improvising rhythm both solo and in ensemble settings. The workshop is open to musicians of all levels who are interested in deepening their rhythmic awareness and improvisational skills.
