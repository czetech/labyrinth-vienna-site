mainTitle: The phrasing of makam
teacher: ross-daly.yaml
---
This course with **Ross Daly** focuses on the study of modal music through phrasing and melodic development. Drawing on his lifelong engagement with makam and related modal traditions, Ross works with participants on understanding how melodies unfold, how tension and release are shaped, and how improvisation grows out of form and character rather than abstract theory. The emphasis is on careful listening, repetition, and internalization of the modal language, offering musicians a grounded approach to playing within these traditions while developing their own musical voice.
