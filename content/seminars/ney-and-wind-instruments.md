This workshop with **Christos Barbas** explores approaches to the ney and other wind instruments across traditional, classical, and contemporary contexts. Drawing on his background in Middle Eastern and Mediterranean music as well as new music practices, Christos works with participants on tone, phrasing, modal understanding, and ensemble playing. Through repertoire, listening, and practical exercises, the session looks at how traditional material can inform both interpretation and new compositions. The workshop is open to wind players interested in expanding their musical language across styles and traditions.
