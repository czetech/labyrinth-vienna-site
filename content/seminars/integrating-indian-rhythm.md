This workshop with **Bernhard Schimpelsberger** looks at practical ways of integrating concepts from Indian rhythm into Western music practice. Drawing on his background in South Indian rhythmic systems and his work across contemporary, improvised, and hybrid musical settings, Bernhard will introduce approaches to subdivision, phrasing, and time that can be applied in a variety of musical contexts. The session will be hands-on and discussion-based, aimed at musicians interested in expanding their rhythmic vocabulary and developing a more flexible sense of time.
