title: About Us

We are starting the Labyrinth workshops in Vienna, in the Hietzing area of the city, where the Alps begin. In the summer heat of August, participants can spend a full week at the Bildungszentrum, a center with spacious green gardens and all the facilities needed for music workshops, including a concert hall.

You will spend the week together with teachers and fellow students, with the option to stay directly at the center or in comfortable, affordable accommodation within a 10-minute walk. The location is also just 5 minutes away from the U4 metro line. Fresh, daily cooked meals are shared with students and teachers, creating a communal and focused atmosphere throughout the week in one of the coziest and calmest corners of Vienna.

We truly believe that Vienna is missing this kind of concept. We are a group of musicians running the project, with the aim of keeping it as accessible and affordable as possible for everyone interested.

Now that we have given you an idea of the setting and conditions, we would like to say a few words about the musical focus. Our aim is to concentrate on areas that are closely connected to our past activities and that have particular social and geographical relevance in Austria and Germany. For this reason, our focus will be on Central Asian, Afghan, Indian, Eastern, and Central European musical traditions.

As this is our first edition, we felt it was important to invite some of the torchbearers of the Labyrinth tradition—such as Ross Daly, the founder of Labyrinth—alongside a number of new teachers.

Please get in touch with us if you would like more information or assistance with registration.

Yours truly,

_Anna, Ioana, Mehdi, Johannes, Petr, Burag_
