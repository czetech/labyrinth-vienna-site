  Ross Daly is a lifelong musical traveler whose journeys through the Middle
  East, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent have shaped him into one of
  the most influential figures in contemporary modal music. His deep engagment
  with these traditions led him to establish the Labyrinth Musical Workshop in
  1982. Labyrinth also is an institution that, since settling in the village of
  Houdetsi on Crete in 2002, has become an international crossroads for
  musicians. Each year, Labyrinth hosts seminars and masterclasses with some of
  the world’s leading traditional music masters, creating a vibrant community
  where students and artists meet, learn, and collaborate. Today, it stands as
  Greece’s foremost center for modal and traditional music education.


  Daly has released over 35 albums, blending his own compositions with unique
  arrangements of traditional melodies gathered throughout his travels. His work
  not only preserves these traditions but reimagines them through a contemporary
  lens.


  He also originatd the term _Contemporary Modal Music_, defining a creative
  approach that draws inspiration from the vast modal traditions stretching from
  Western Africa to Western China. Daly continues to promote this evolving
  musical landscape, inviting new generations of musicians to explore and expand
  its possibilities.
