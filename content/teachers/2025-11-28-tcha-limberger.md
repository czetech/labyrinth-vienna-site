  Tcha Limberger is a distinguished multi-instrumentalist, composer, and
  educator whose deep emotional connection to music has shaped a career spanning
  decades and continents. Known for his rare ability to move effortlessly
  between genres, he has become a significant force in both traditional and
  contemporary music, collaborating widely and inspiring audiences around the
  world.


  Drawing on cultural themes and his Romani heritage, Limberger has contributed
  meaningfully to world music and influenced a new generation of musicians. He
  studied the music of Kalotaszeg with Neti Sándor and the Budapest Magyar Nóta
  style with Horváth Béla. His dedication to the language and cultural context
  of these traditions has earned him recognition as one of the leading
  contemporary figures in the music of the Carpathian Basin. His album _Fekete
  éjszaka, borulj a világra_ with the Budapest Gypsy Orchestra received a
  Songlines nomination in 2015.


  Born into a renowned Belgian Manouche family, he grew up surrounded by diverse
  musical traditions, including Django Reinhardt’s Gypsy swing. His early start
  included solo Flamenco performances at the age of eight. His interests later
  expanded to the music of the Aimara and Quechua people of Bolivia, as well as
  modern classical composition, which he studied with Dick Vanderharst. He also
  cites Koen De Cauter and Herman Schamp as formative influences.


  Today, Limberger remains an influential presence in jazz, folk, and world
  music. His current projects include I Silenti with Fabrizio Cassol, the
  all-string swing ensemble Les Violons de Bruxelles, and The Viper Club, which
  celebrates the music of Stuff Smith.
