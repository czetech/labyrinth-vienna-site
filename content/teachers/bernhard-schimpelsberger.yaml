  Bernhard Schimpelsberger is an Austrian percussionist and composer known for
  his innovative approach to rhythm. His deep study of Indian classical rhythmic
  systems and his ability to translate them into Western musical contexts have
  shaped his distinctive artistic voice. With finely tuned musical sensitivity
  and technical mastery, he has become a sought-after collaborator for leading
  artists around the world.


  Praised as “one of the most technically gifted and tasteful players” by
  Drummer Magazine UK, Schimpelsberger performs on a unique, multi-layered drum
  kit that allows him to create richly textured, melodic soundscapes. Critics
  describe his music as an intricate blend of colors, elements, virtuosity, and
  unexpected turns.


  He trained under renowned Indian percussion masters Suresh Talwalkar and
  Trilok Gurtu, and his collaborations with Anoushka Shankar, Akram Khan, and
  Nitin Sawhney further developed a drumming style reminiscent of a tabla
  virtuoso. His musical curiosity has led him to work with artists such as
  flamenco dancer Israel Galván, Cuban percussion ensemble Osain del Monte, and
  Brazilian guitarist Yamandu Costa. He currently performs as a guest soloist
  with South African cellist Abel Selaocoe and with orchestras internationally.


  His audio-visual project _Rhythm Diaries_, documenting his travels and
  collaborations in Brazil, India, South Africa, and across Europe, has received
  worldwide acclaim and multiple awards.


  Schimpelsberger’s compositions have been featured at Beethovenfest Bonn, the
  Rowing World Cup Championships in Ottensheim/Linz, and performed by ensembles
  such as the Britten Sinfonia and Malta’s National Dance Company.
