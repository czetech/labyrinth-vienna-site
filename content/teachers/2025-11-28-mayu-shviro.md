headline: Modal music for bowed instrument
description: >-
  Born in Jerusalem to Japanese and Iraqi parents, Mayu began studying classical
  cello at the age of six. At eighteen she discovered the world of modal music,
  a turning point that led her to explore the Arabic, Turkish, and Azeri
  traditions through the voice of her instrument. Drawn to the depth and beauty
  of these musical worlds, she dedicated herself to studying with masters such
  as Evgenios Voulgaris in Greece and Elshan Mansurov in Azerbaijan.


  Mayu has performed and recorded across a wide range of styles, collaborating
  with artists including Piris Eliyahu, Shai Maestro, Ofer Mizrahi, Dudu Tassa &
  Jonny Greenwood, Arkho, Itamar Doari, Ross Daly, Kelly Thoma, Yonathan
  Avishai, and Avishai Cohen. She has also appeared as a soloist with the East
  and West Orchestra.


  Her first album, _The Old Man and the Sea_ (2024), pairs her music with her
  own hand-crafted animation, inviting listeners into a parallel universe
  inspired by Hemingway’s novel.


  Today, Mayu continues to create her own musical language shaped by the
  traditions and people she has encountered along the way, blending jazz, modal
  music from Turkey, Azerbaijan, and the Arab world, and the natural soundscapes
  that inspire her.
