  Christos Barbas is a versatile Greek multi-instrumentalist and composer known
  for his creative and wide-ranging musical approach. He began his musical
  studies early, learning recorder, piano, baroque music, harmony, and
  counterpoint, and completed his formal Western music training in 2002. He
  later studied musicology and ethnomusicology at the Aristotle University of
  Thessaloniki and SOAS in London. Since 2003 he has focused on the ney, as well
  as Sufi and classical Ottoman music, studying with leading performers in
  Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey, while also exploring instruments such as the
  kaval, bansuri, Irish whistles, and various bagpipes across traditions from
  folk music to jazz and free improvisation.


  Barbas is especially interested in a creative engagement with older sacred and
  popular musical traditions, valuing their timelessness and expressive
  possibilities over strict notions of authenticity. He communicates this
  through his performances, his compositions, interdisciplinary collaborations,
  and his work as a teacher.


  He has written music for a wide range of settings, including dance, theatre,
  film, and modal ensembles, and has released nine albums of original work with
  groups such as Yeden, Neda, Magnanimus Trio, and collaborations with Murat
  Aydemir, Peppe Frana, and Efrén López. Alongside his own projects, he has
  worked with prominent artists including Ross Daly, Zohar Fresco, L’Ham de Foc,
  Evgenios Voulgaris, Maria Farantouri, Anja Lechner, and Björn Meyer,
  performing internationally and recording widely in the field of contemporary
  modal music for labels such as An Music, Felmay, and ECM.


  Barbas has taught ney, kaval, improvisation, and modal music composition at
  institutions in Arta and Thessaloniki, as well as at the Labyrinth Musical
  Workshop in Crete and cultural centers throughout Europe. He is also the
  artistic director of Labyrinth Catalunya.
