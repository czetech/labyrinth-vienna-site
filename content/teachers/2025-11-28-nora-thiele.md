  Raised in a family of musicians and theater artists, Nora Thiele studied
  ethnic percussion and piano in Leipzig and has worked as a freelance musician
  since 2004. She is widely regarded as a pioneering figure in the frame drum
  world, known for her sensitive virtuosity and her work in historical European
  percussion from the Middle Ages to early Baroque. For her global music and
  jazz projects, she developed a custom frame drum set that blends tunable
  natural-skin drums with cymbals and extends the concept of the traditional
  drum kit.


  Thiele is committed to expanding the frame drum repertoire. She co-develops
  the Frame Drum Library, publishes original works for frame drums, and has
  inspired contemporary composers such as Klaus Huber and Bernd Franke to write
  orchestral pieces for her. As a composer, she creates chamber music that
  brings together instruments and influences from different cultures.


  With more than a thousand performances across Europe, the Middle East, and
  China, she has collaborated with a wide range of artists and ensembles,
  including Cecilia Bartoli, Ensemble Avantgarde, La Folia Baroque Orchestra,
  Lena Chamamyan, Nederlands Kamerorkest, Glen Velez, and many others.


  Drawing on decades of study in European, Middle Eastern, South Indian, West
  African, and Afro-American rhythmic traditions, Thiele has developed her own
  rhythm theory focused on awareness, improvisation, and stylistic fluency. She
  teaches at the Weimar University of Music and leads workshops and
  masterclasses internationally.


  Her recent projects include a solo program combining percussion, piano, loops,
  and electronics, the AUREA duo with painter Larissa Böhler, and the Co Co
  Collective, which performs rhythm-centered minimalist music. She is also
  active as an artistic director, curator, and festival organizer, and is a
  member of Music Women Thuringia in support of gender equality in the arts.
