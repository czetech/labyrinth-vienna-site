**ACCOMMODATION**

You may arrange your own accommodation, or we can host you in a room at [<u>Bundesinternat Wien am Himmelhof</u>](https://himmelhof-wien.at/),  a boarding school and internat located just 10 minutes’ walking distance from the [**Bildungszentrum**](https://bildungszentrum-an-der-wien.at/), where the workshops take place. This area is beautiful, surrounded by large gardens and close to the foothills of the Alps.

The cost is **35 € for a double room** and **45 € for a private room**. All rooms include a private bathroom and toilet.

Alternatively, we may have a limited number of large shared rooms available at the kindergarten directly next to the Bildungszentrum and the workshop locations. These rooms can accommodate up to 15 students in total, with **5 people per room**, shared facilities, and a cost of **15 € per person per night**. For this option, you will need to bring your own sleeping bag.

If you select any of these options, we will contact you to help find the most suitable arrangement.
