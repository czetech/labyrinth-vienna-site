**How do I register?**  
Registration is done via the registration form on our website. By submitting the form, you reserve a place in the workshop. After registering, payment is required within the stated time frame to confirm your participation. Details will be sent by email.

**Can I change workshops or attend more than one?**  
Workshops are designed as continuous processes across the week, so changing workshops is generally not possible. In exceptional cases, and if space allows, a change may be possible after arrival. Participating in more than one workshop simultaneously is not possible.

**Do I need to bring my own instrument?**  
Yes. If your chosen workshop requires an instrument, participants are expected to bring their own. If this is not possible, please contact us in advance and we will try to help find a solution.

**What level is required to participate?**  
A medium to advanced level is recommended, as the work progresses intensively. However, participants are welcome to engage at their own pace. Observing and listening are also valuable ways of participating.

**Can I record the lessons?**  
Yes. Audio and video recording for personal study and archival purposes is allowed.

**What happens if I need to cancel?**  
If you cancel your participation up to one month before the workshop starts, already paid fees will be refunded, minus bank transfer costs.  
Cancellations less than one month before the start date cannot be refunded.  
In special cases such as illness or unforeseen circumstances, cancellations are handled individually.

**Are meals included, and are there menu options?**  
Meals are offered with different menu options, including omnivorous, vegetarian, and vegan.

**I have a food allergy or intolerance. Can this be accommodated?**  
Yes. Please indicate any allergies or intolerances during registration so they can be taken into account.
